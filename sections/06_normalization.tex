There are two ways to normalize pattern signatures.
The first one (used in {\it gpat gridhis}, {\it gpat pointshis} and {\it gpat polygon}) works independently on each of the pattern signatures.
The role of the second one (used in {\it gpat_globnorm} is to normalize all of the pattern signatures together. 
Decision on the normalization method and its type should depends on both, numerical signatures and dissimilarity measures used.
For example, the class co-occurrence histogram signature should be locally normalized (used in {\it gpat gridhis}, {\it gpat pointshis} and {\it gpat polygon}) before a segmentation using the Jensen Shannon Divergence measure.
However, in case of a segmentation based on the landscape indices a global normalization {\it gpat_globnorm} is recommended, while local normalization should be avoided.

\subsection{01}

Normalization to the [0,1] interval.

\subsection{pdf}

Normalization to pdf (sum(hi) = 1).

\subsection{N01}

Normalization to N(0,1) (hi = (hi - avg) / std).

\subsection{ind01}

Normalization to [0,1] for 72 landscape indices.
Used in the {\it gpat\_globnorm} module only.
It accepts only the grids built using the selected landscape indices vector signature (\it linds}.

\subsection{none}

Normalization process is skipped.
